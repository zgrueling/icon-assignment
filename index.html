			<h1> How to design age-friendly cities </h1>
		</div>


		<div class="intro">
			
			<p> Cities have a lot to offer older adults who want to age in place. Density and diversity mean many older adults can access services and meet social needs right in their neighborhood. But urban spaces also present barriers to older adults that can discourage or prevent them from benefitting from these resources, negatively impacting physical and mental health.
			</p>

			<p> The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that by 2035, <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2018/03/graying-america.html">older adults will outnumber children</a> in the United States for the first time in the nation's history. As the U.S. population ages, it will become increasingly critical to design and maintain urban spaces with older adults in mind.
			</p>

			<p> Here are a few design features that can help make cities safe and welcoming for older adults—and people of all ages.

				<h4> Outdoor Seating </h4>

				<p> An abundance of outdoor seating is vital for older adults navigating public spaces. Benches and other seating provide a place to rest and can serve as informal social spaces for older adults. However, not all benches are created equal. Special consideration should be given to the material of the seating (consider, for example: will the surface become unbearably hot in the summer sun?) and, critically, the presence of armrests or other features that can allow older adults to stand up and sit down safely and comfortably. Covered outdoor seating to provide shelter from the elements is especially appreciated, particularly near public transit.

				<h4> Sidewalks & Curbs </h4>

				<p> Many older adults use wheelchairs, walkers and canes. Many others have limited visions. Sidewalks that are narrow, uneven, severely cracked, crowded or obstructed by objects (e.g. garbage cans, bags) create risks for older adults and can limit their ability to move through urban spaces. Besides maintaining clean, clear and even pavements, cities should ensure that every corner features dropped curbs that taper off to road level.

				<h4> Toilets </h4>

				<p> Adequate public bathrooms are crucial for older adults in the city, for whom incontinence is a concern, but mere availability is not sufficient to meet their needs. Toilets must be conveniently located, physically accessible, and well-labeled in public spaces. In addition, bathrooms must be clean and well-maintained in order for older adults to feel comfortable using them. Designers should make sure doors are not too heavy or difficult to operate, and stalls and other spaces should be large enough to easily maneuver.

				<h4> Green Space </h4>

				<p> Green space can be a great benefit for older adults, promoting exercise and social interaction, both of which can support their mental health. Parks can serve as informal community spaces for older adults and allow them to participate in civic life, as well as providing the opportunity to enjoy the natural world, while tree-lined streets can make navigating neighborhoods more pleasant, as well as safer, particularly in hot weather. But trees can also obstruct or clutter sidewalks, endangering older adults, and not every park is a welcoming and accessible space. Parks should be designed or modified with older adults in mind, with attention given to the presence, quality, and steepness of paved pathways, the availability and quality of seating and bathrooms, and general cleanliness. However, even a poorly-designed park can help combat "urban heat island effect," which poses a serious health risk to older adults in hot summer months.
